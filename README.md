# My repository for Study-Well 

## Commands
- ```yarn run start // Starts the server```
- ```yarn run build // Compiles the TS code and build nextjs```
- ```yarn run test // Run tests```

### This is a basic project to familiarize myself with Nextjs, writing Nodejs, user authentications and session management.

### Built with HTML, CSS, React, NextJS, NodeJS, MongoDB.

## Why ?
- Besides wanting to familiarize myself with Nextjs and React, I wanted to build a web application for students to easily share their study resources and form study groups!
